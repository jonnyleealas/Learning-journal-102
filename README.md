## Hi, my name is Jonathon Lee.
Today I learned about a usefull tool called Growth Mindset.

### Growth Mindset
Having a growth mindest is important to have when learning something new. It helps get passed limitations when faced with failure. It means having patience when something doesn't make sense. It means having an open attitude. It involves, trying new strategies to find answers that were seemingly impossible at first glance. We must however, avoid comparing ourselves with the progress of others. We each have our own way of learning. We will get there when we get there. A growth mindset also means believing that we are capable of learning new things throught time, study, hardwork, and persistance. We may not have the knowledge or capabilities at the moment. However, if we keep working at it, and we keep trying strategies; it is possible to gain new knowlege and capabilities. 

### Examples

Fixed Mindset| Growth Mindset
------------ | -------------
Avoids challenges | Views challenges as opportunities to grow
Afraid of critisism | Loves constructive critisim and uses it as a vehicle for improvement
Threatened by the success of others | Inspired by the success of others


### Reminders for staying in a Growth Mindset.

- Don't compare yourself with others. 
- No one is good at first. 
- Keep trying new things.
- Ask for help!
