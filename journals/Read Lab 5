# Things we I learned today about CSS

First thing that comes to mind is a featherless bird vs therered bird analogy. We were shown a baby bird without feathers to sybmolize html without css. Then we were shown a beautiful parrot with colored feathers to symbolize html when css is added to it. So, css is what gives html it's color and style. 
Also, I learned that html needs to know to communicate with css. We can tell it to communicate with css by adding <link href="css/styles.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"/> in the head of the html file.
