## Reading Lab 8 Operators and Loops

Two types of operators: Comparison and Logical. Comparison usually return values of true or false. Logical compare results of more than one comparison operator.

Loops are a little tricky. They are code that do a thing until a thing is either true or false. Or at least that's one of their function. The code can run forever unless certain things are met. Like if a questions answer is yes and only yes, the code will keep on running unless yes is answered. Well thats an example. There's much more to learn for me here lol.


## Opererators
* && Tests more than one condition
* || If either expression evaluates to true then true. If both return false then expression is false.
* ! Reverses the expression. If false before ! then true.
* == This is used to determine if two values are the same. Booleans are Booleans and Numbers are Numbers.

# Few no no's
* Don't get in an endless loop cituation.
* Arrays take up a block of memory instead of a single block.
* Avoid infinit loops.


# Loops 
Loops check conditions. If it returns true, a code block will run. Then it will check again and if it returns true, a code will block run again. It repeats until condition returns false.

# Types of Loops
* **For** - Code will run a specific number of times.
* **While** - Code will continue for as long as condition is true.
* **Do While** -It will run the statement at least once if condition is false.
# Ex: for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++)
