## Read: 07 - Programming with JavaScript

## What I learned

Javascript is a progam that can create games, visuals, and uses algebra! In school I always thought algebra was bull, but look at me now :) lol. Today I was able to a code pop up question called a promp into my website. Also, Ron told me that javascript was invented in a little over a week. Which is crazy. Soon after, businesses all over the world adopted javascript. So many businesses use it that the language hasn't changed; hence why it can be confusing. So far I'm having trouble keeping track of the variables being used and the order in which to use them. However, one cool thing about javascript is using function. Imagine you had code that was pages long and you had to re-type it everytime you needed the code. With function you can type the code inside of function. Next give function a name. Then all you have to do is use that name to use the code you worked so hard to write.

# Other tidbits
* "use strict",= makes java evaluate code a little bit stronger.
* console.log('good morning'), sends a message over to console. you can test using this to see that its sending correctly.
* var userName=prompt( 'hello'); sends message to promt when evoked or called.
* .toLowerCase(); = helps read uppercase read lowercase
* Function= wrap a group of code.
  function askSithQuestions(){
    var newQuestion= promp('can you beat master yoda')
    console.log(newQuestion);
} 
* Don't use document.write in 201.

* We can wrap a set of commands within a function. that helps so we dont have to keep writing the same code over and over.

* Evoke means calling the function.

* functiona add(a,b){
return a+b;}

* console.log is a way to test code. It will print to the log so you can see if its working correctly.
* Global var= anything can acces that.
