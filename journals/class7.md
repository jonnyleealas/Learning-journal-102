## What I learned

Does cap Yes = lower case yes. Users break things. If a million people use it youre gonna a million different anwsweres. you =want to have eror checking in your code. I know when th euser enters info I know what case its going to be. doucument.write= dont use this in 201. we are using it now becuase we need something quicker. Its just a fixer for now. 
#
"use strict",= makes java evaluate code a little bit stronger.
#console.log('good morning'), sends a message over to console. you can test using this to see that its sending correctly.

#
var userName=prompt( 'hello'); sends message to promt when evoked or called.
#
.toLowerCase(); = helps read upper or lower case?
#
if (isSithLord)=== 'no')
var wannabe=('are you tryiing to be?'),
#
Function= wrap a group of code.
function askSithQuestions(){
    var newQuestion= promp('can you beat master yoda')
    console.log(newQuestion);

} this is not called
#
this is called
#
asksithQuestions(){
    var newQuestion= promp('can you beat master yoda')
    console.log(newQuestion);

} 
#
funciotn isTraining(){
    if (isSithlordOrMaster==='YES')


#
We can wrap a set of commands within a function. that helps so we dont have to keep writing the same code over and over.

# evoke means calling the function.
#
Ex: function darthvader= (){};

}
darthVader(){

}

#
functiona add(a,b){
return a+b;}
#
envoked
#
#
var ficePlusTen= add(5,10);
add(5,10);
#
add(110,34);
#
add(45,45);
#
add(99,1);
#
console.log is a way to test code. It will print to the log so you can see if its working correctly.
#
          
Global var= anything can acces that.
#
NaN= not a number
#
add('c',34); = c34
#
order
1. Global var
1. function deleractions
1. envokes at the bottom

# 
wrap existing code into functions for lab 7
