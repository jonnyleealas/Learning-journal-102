## Java Script 6a

Today I learned a bit of Java Script. Well really I was introduced to java scrip. It seems to add a bit of if statemens. 

# Ex: If this then this= 

Also we created variables. 

# Ex: var Turltle= ();

I'm guessing we can use a combination of if statements and variable to tell the computer what to do.

Maybe something like : x= turtle
                      y = eats
                      z = Bunny

We should be able to say. x+y = Turtle eats 

Last thing I learned is that you must be sure to avoid typing errors. My code didn't work properly, because I mis-spelled a word.
