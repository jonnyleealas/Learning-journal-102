Today we learned about git. It was a headache and a half trying to learn how to use it. It's taken alot of repetion to just get moving. I'm still working my way into understanding how to use it. 

# What Git Helps us do.
Git help us take files to and from github. Github is a place that holds files as a saftey precaution in case something is deleted in your computer. If something is deleted you can go into github, and copy and past into your computer files; also called cloning. Git also helps us share files with people. We can go and see what they've been working on and they can see our work. If want want to collaborate everything is in one place.
