Today I learned a little about Text Editor and Terminal. And no, it has nothing to do with auto correct on your phone or finding the right terminal on your plane trip.

A text editor is a tool that help you write code. It should be simple and to the point. It shouldn't have things like bold or underline. Some editors come with syntax highlight or different themes that help with lesson eye fatigue. Try a few and see which works for you.

If you are a mac user then you are probably familiar with the finder folder. Looks something like this. Finder We can use this folder to find things like music files or pictures. But sometimes files are hidden in the computer. A faster way to find them is to use the terminal app in your mac. You can pull it up by typing command + shift and searching terminal. It may seem like the matrix when you're using it, but it's faster and more effient. And that looks like this.
