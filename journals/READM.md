## *What I know About Markdown's*

Markdowns are a simple way to write syntax without having to know much HTML. Say for example I need a simple website to show my noob coding skills; I could use *markdowns* for that. Markdowns help text look a bit more fun. Say for example I want to type my name. Ex: Jonny. That looks a bit boring. What if I add a few of these ** at beggining and end of my name. What would happen? 

# Without *: Jonny
# With *: *Jonny*
>Makes my name a bit cooler dont you think?
Here's another thing. How do you think I made some of the words look Bolder? Easy, I just added a hashtag # before typing the word. Check out the example below!

Without #: Jonny
# With #: Jonny
>Adding a hashtag # at the begging makes the name big and bold. However, I'd like for only the name to be bold and not the whole section, but I'm sure I'll figure out how to do that as I keep learning.

To conclude, Markdown is a cool and simple way to write text, and it makes things a bit more fun. You can also add pictures, weblinks, number lists, and blockquotes. There are serveral other ways to modify text with Markdowns, but more of that as I keep learning! 

# *Cheers, Jonny.*

>Bonus Point: Can you tell me why "cheers, Jonny looks the way it does?
