## How Computers Work

After watching the playlist it made me realize that at it's smallest part, computers are very simple. But still very complicated lol.
# Bits 
Bits are the smallest a unit of memory a computer can store. The more bits the more is stored. For example : an 8 bit music file won't sound as good as a 32 bit because it stores less.

# Binary
Binary is what is used to write data or commands. 1's and 0's multiplied together to form a type of language. All code starts at binary. Binary is like turning on a light switch and turning it off. At it's core that's what it does. 
 
 # Computers Due 4 things
 1. Input
 1. Storage
 1. Process 
 1. Output

 # Operating System
 This is the master program that helps the things above work. It's the puppet master behind the seens, but actually hides in plain sight.

After watching the videos I also realized even more, that we are only limited by our imagination when it comes to tech. We really can create just about anything if we can figure out how to give the computer the correct commands.
